# AI-Diagnosis
# 🧠 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

An intelligent, web-based application that leverages **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to provide medical diagnosis support. This system allows users to:

- 🩺 Predict common diseases based on clinical input parameters
- 💬 Chat with an AI-powered medical assistant (chatbot) for general health-related queries

Built using **Streamlit**, **OpenAI GPT**, and trained ML models for conditions like **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson’s Disease**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This system is intended for educational and informational purposes only. It does **not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment**.
